I undertook a task focused on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using a real-world dataset. I selected the well-known Titanic dataset from Kaggle for this project.

## Key Highlights:
- Cleaned the dataset by addressing missing values (e.g., filling Age with the median, dropping the Cabin column).
- Conducted in-depth exploratory analysis on key variables such as Survival, Sex, Passenger Class, and Age using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Uncovered meaningful patterns:
 Females and first-class passengers had significantly higher survival rates.
 Younger passengers were more likely to survive.
- Presented findings through bar plots, histograms, and a correlation heatmap to visualize trends and relationships between features.

 ## Tools Used: 
 - Python
 - Pandas
 - Seaborn
 - Matplotlib
